// The Countermove network: one seller's proven dispute protects every other seller.
//
// When a shop on Countermove wins a dispute where its evidence contradicted the buyer
// (a "never arrived" claim on a parcel the carrier shows delivered or signed for, or an
// "unauthorized" claim on a payment from the buyer's own account and address), it shares
// a report: a one-way hash of the buyer's PayPal email, the claim type, what the evidence
// showed and the result. No names, addresses, amounts or order details leave the shop.
// Before another shop ships to that buyer, or while it answers their dispute, it sees
// how many other shops reported them.
//
// In this demo the other shops are simulated (fixed reports below, labeled as such in
// the UI). This shop's own reports come from its real case history.
